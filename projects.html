            <h2>Amp Lab Speaker Design</h2>
            <p class="sub">I joined the AMP Lab as soon as I knew what it was. I was so
              interested in being able to actually start building/designing
              electronics instead of learning how to theoretically analyse them.</p>
            <p class="sub">I'm a music geek, so I felt like I wanted to learn about the
              science behind sound while designing a speaker. My plan is to
              start by making this a wireless bluetooth speaker and morphing
              it into the center speaker of a wireless surround sound system</p>
            <p class="sub">Sadly, due to covid, this project will remain in the design
              phase until further notice. I will be continuing work on this
              project, it is not retired!</p>

            <h2>Xbox 360 Kinect Programming</h2>
            <p class="sub">I have heard about people using the sensors on a
              kinect before to do a multitude of different programs. This
              really interested me, so I wanted to try this myself.</p>
            <p class="sub">I want to learn to use the kinect to learn about
              object tracking and to figure out how to use the data it collects
              via the IR sensor.</p>
            <p class="sub">To do this, I would like to create a game, object
              tracking and learning how to manipulate objects and other
              variables via the tracking, and create a program to turn the
              IR sensor data into a 3D model of an object.</p>
              <p class="sub">Currently, I am waiting to recieve PC adapters
                for the kinect.</p>

            <h2>Web development</h2>
            <p class="sub">I was interested in creating myself a personal
              website, and shortly into learning about web development I
              realized how much I love it.</p>
            <p class="sub">I am planning to constantly update and revise my
              personal website here. Besides just changing relevant information,
              I want to also recreate the sight with my updated knowledge to see
              how my understanding and style has changed</p>
            <p class="sub">My personal site is my only example currently, but
              if you would like to see what my site looked like previously,

            <h2>Reprogramming Data Structures in C++</h2>
            <p class="sub">I have previously taken 2114 from the CS department
              which covers a variety of data structures. The only thing is that
              they taught us how it works in Java.</p>
            <p class="sub">I started taking more classes in C and C++, and
              especially now that I am taking ECE 3574, Applied Software Design
              (C++), I want to make sure I know how these data structures work
              in other languages</p>
            <p class="sub">Basically I will be reprogramming all of the data
              structures I learned about in my previous class from Java to C++.</p>

            <h2>Programmed Games</h2>
            <p class="sub">Games has always been a big part of what I do. I play
              by meself and with friends. It's a huge hobby of mine.</p>
            <p class="sub">I've always been interested in learning to program
              games, and to start with something a little simpler I wanted to
              use the pygames library in python to make some smaller games</p>
            <p class="sub">Eventually, I will learn to use Unity or the Unreal
              Engine. For now, with all the other things I am doing, I will be
              taking it slow and not try to overwhelm myself.</p>
