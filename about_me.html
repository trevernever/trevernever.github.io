          <p class="sub">I am a student at Virginia Tech. I am currently pursuing
            a double major in Electrical Engineering, with a focus in Controls,
            Robotics, and Autonomy, and Computer Science, with a focus in Software
            Development.</p>
          <p class="sub">I am an officer of the TRE, or the Teaching Robotics and
            Engineering club, where we teach things like arduino to student that
            would like to know more.</p>
          <p class="sub">I am also a member of the AMP lab at Virginia Tech
            where I am designing a portable bluetooth speaker</p>

          <h5 class="center">Music</h5>
          <p class="sub">I am very passionate about music. I have loved to listen
            to music ever since I was little, and was lucky to be given the chance
            to learn to play at the School of Rock.</p>
          <p class="sub">The school of Rock was where I first learned to play and
            fall in love with my instruments. It was there I learned to play four
            instruments: Drums, Bass, Guitar, and Keyboard. I went and learned a
            fifth one by myself, the Ocarina.</p>
          <p class="sub">I would probably say the 2 instruments I enjoy playing
            the most is Drums and Bass.</p>

          <h5 class="center">Programming</h5>
          <p class="sub">I really thoroughly enjoy programming, I started out
            taking some programming classes in high school and from then on I
            knew what I wanted to do.</p>
          <p class="sub">I have learned a good variety of languages since my
            time at Virginia Tech: Python, Java, Javascript, C, C++, HTML,
            and CSS. Some in class and some from online courses like Udemy and
            LinkedIn.</p>

          <h5 class="center">Walking/Biking</h5>
          <p class="sub">I used to be more of an inside person, but after a
            little while at VT, I started to really enjoy going outside. Luckily
            there is a surplus of trails around campus to walk and bike through
            many different scenes.</p>
          <p class="sub">I love the cold, so my favorite time to walk is in Fall
            and Winter. As long as it's not freezing, I love going outside in
            just shorts and a T-shirt when its cold.</p>
